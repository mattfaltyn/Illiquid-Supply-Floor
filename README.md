# Illiquid Supply Floor (ISF)

Chart of the Illiquid Supply Floor (ISF) model (in collaboration with [Will Clemente](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII)) with Plan B's traditional Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model. In combination with one another, these models serve as interesting price bands with ISF serving as a floor and S2F serving as a ceiling. 

- Blue: S2F
- Maroon: Market
- Grey: ISF
